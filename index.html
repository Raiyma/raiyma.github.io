            <p>Muslim Women's Dress in Accordance with the Qur'an and Sunnah based on Hijabul Mar'atil Muslimah by Ash-Sheik Muhammad Nassirud-Deen Al-Albani Translated and Abridged by Mahmoud Murad Praise be to Allah and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger and upon his honorable companions and those who have followed his example with piety.
               This paper has been prepared in response to a deterioration in the condition of Muslim women of this day and age, which is a consequence of the misconception that how a woman dresses is of little importance, as long as she performs her obligatory acts of worship. This misconception is not restricted to Muslim women in the West, but unfortunately is shared by many of their sisters in the East.
               In the Glorious Qur'an we are told:
               And let there arise out of you a nation inviting to what is good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong. Those are the ones who are successful. Qur'an 3:104
               Abu S'aed al-Khudri relates that he heard the Prophet (saws) say:
               He of you who sees something wrong should correct it with his hand; if he is unable to do that he should condemn it with his tongue; if he is unable to do that he should at least resent it in his heart, and this is the lowest degree of faith.Muslim It is clear that we must draw the attention of our Muslim sisters to the importance of wearing Islamic dress.
